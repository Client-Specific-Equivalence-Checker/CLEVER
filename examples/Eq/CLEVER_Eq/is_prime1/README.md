- The client calls the library with the flag *b* not set.
- The original library returns 0 if the flag is not set. Otherwise it iterates over a fixed list of small primes checking if *x* is evenly divisible by any of them. If so, the library returns 0, indicating that *x* is prime.
- The updated library adds a check to ensure that *x* is not in fact one of the small primes.
- The change does not affect the client.
